Changes from Monday (all done)
*length-of-autonomous-traverse* is the cycle distance
* new parameter that's 50m (*autonomous-waypoint-distance*)
* same lidar compression all around (already done)
* Set case 6 nav compression to 6 (already done)

Changes from Ryan

* nav-payload -> navcam-payload everywhere
* haz-payload -> hazcam-payload everywhere

1: high latency kitchen sink - latency changed to 120						; changed
2: high latency balance - bumper bits increased to match input					; ?? I think it's right (and not used)
3: high latency kitchen sink - lidar on mast, made it the primary payload			; NO.  Cell H7 indicates that the autonomy uses stereo  images

   The post-autonomy-payload isn't in the spreadsheet and needs to be discussed.
   There was an error in the :length-of-autonomous-traverse field.  It's now 8.

   I'm not sure what length-of-autonomous

Questions:
There are two cases with LIDAR's as the primary driving sensor, does your model ignore the navcams in these cases?

The model has a parameter which is what type of data to capture and bundle into a single message (that would be multiple actual packets).  For LIDAR-oriented cases, that
message includes only LIDAR data.  Therefore, during driving, no images are coming down at all, just the LIDAR data.  In other words, the science images per meter idea isn't
implemented (and it's not in the spreadsheet either).

There is a parameter for the amount of time it takes to capture the bundle.  Right now, that's always 0 sec.  There's always a bundle being collected and transmitted.  As soon
as one finishes transmitting, the next collection starts.  This stream of navigation messages can be interrupted by saying that the next one in the sequence will be of a
different message type (usually larger).  For instance, when the bumper triggers, a larger bundle of data is scheduled as the next 'navigation' bundle.  When that's done, it
goes back to Collecting and sending the default type for that case.

Autonomous rovers are different in that they don't send their navigation image pairs to the ground.  Right now, they're just sending a larger bundle when they reach the
commanded waypoint.  This should probably be modified, but I'm not sure whether they should transmit images or depth & hazard maps.  What changes make sense here depends on
what we do with modeling science images during driving.

Why does the HAZCAM_PAYLOAD=0 across the board?

Uh.  Umm.  That's a bug.  The parameter declared in the model is *hazcam-payload*, while the parameter in the cases file entries is :haz-payload, which turns into
*haz-payload*.  So the wrong variable is getting the value.  The effect is that the hazard camera(s) aren't being accounted for in downlink.

Did we have hazard response time as an input or did you add it?  I think we need to discuss this one a bit.

I added it.  I'm in 269-137 at 4-4530.  I'll be walking to lunch soon but around most of the afternoon.  My cell is 650-269-1904.

In LIDARs galore input, should LIDAR_BITS be *24 for 24 bits/pixel?

Yes.  Garbage in,  garbage out. 

Sorry this took a while, was a bit more to fix.

No problem.  This is great.

Subject: simulation cases

Ryan,
  Here are the simulation cases.  The definitions are in the cases.lisp file.  A sample run is in compare-all.txt.
I'm looking for where I've screwed up the case definitions, and I'm sure there are some places.
 
Here's what I'm getting now.  Note that all of the speeds got a lot lower when I implemented interruptions due to hazards and bumper hits.
 
Some of these orderings make sense, but others don't.  I haven't looked at bumper-car at all, for instance.
